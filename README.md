# Time_Series_Modeling_With_R

Automated Forecasting

auto.arima() can handle both seasonal and nonseasonal ARIMA models

ets() can support both additive and multiplicative models


ARIMA modeling 
1. Perform exploratory data analysis

2. Decomposition of data

3. Test the stationarity

4. Fit model (auto.arima())

5. Calculate forecasts

Other models:
1. The multiplicative model: Y[t]=T[t]∗S[t]∗e[t]

2. Exponential model (HoltWinters() and ets())
